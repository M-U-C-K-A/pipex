### Summary:
Summary: This project will allow you to explore a UNIX mechanism in detail, one that
you are already familiar with, by implementing it in your program.

You must submit a Makefile that compiles your source files. It must not perform
unnecessary relinking.
- Your program must never terminate unexpectedly (e.g., segmentation fault, bus
error, double free, etc.).
- Your program must not have memory leaks.
- If you are unsure, handle errors the same way as the shell command:
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
